# DebtMan

This project is an implementation of the specification found here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/12_bEA9SSmvZQjbH5MzhQmKUNinczgV4uwr81BgvIC38/edit

It is a short technical test involving a comparison of three different simple debt management charging strategies,
presented using an ASP.NET MVC UI.

My solution includes the following elements:

- A simple domain model with unit tests
- Application of the Strategy design pattern
- Application of the Repository design pattern
- Use of StructureMap
- Use of AutoMapper

TODO:

- Improve the styling
- Add ability to edit debtor details
- Add input validation
